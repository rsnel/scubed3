base device: this file/device/database holds all macroblocks, our worst case
threat-model assumes an adversary can make snapshots of it at will

scubed3 partition: a block device whose contents are managed by a scubed3
deamon, writing to a scubed3 partition causes changes to the macroblocks in the base device

macroblocks: the smallest bit of information to someone who doesn't have the
cryptographic key corresponding to it, a macroblock will either change randomly
(each bit changes with a probability of .5) or not at all

mesoblock: in a macroblock a series of mesoblocks are stored, along with
information on where the mesoblock belongs on the scubed3 partition.

indexblock: the first mesoblock in each macroblock contains information
about the other mesoblocks in said macroblock


Threat model
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The adversary has full knowledge about the macroblocks (including history) and
may even have write access to them. This adversary may have keys to some
scubed3 partitions. The goal is to be able to plausibly deny the existance of
partitions to which the adversary has no keys.  Only paranoia level 3 protects
completely against this. We assume the adversary cannot detect read access.


Paranoia levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a new macroblock needs to be selected: 

Level 0: not paranoid

it is selected from all allocated blocks based on it's emptyness, the most
empty block gets selected.

Level 1: moderately paranoid

it is randomly selected from all allocated blocks. This hurts write
performance.

Level 2: just paranoid

a random block of the device is selected. If it happens to be allocated to the
current device, it is used. If it happens to be allocated to another device, it
is updated with a new seqno (therefore every bit will change with a probalility
of .5). If the block is unallocated, it will be added to the device, another
block will be deleted. (this level of paranoia is required for flash media,
this kind of media keeps an internal record about the order in whichs blocks
are written to it) It is only safe if all scubed3 devices are known to and
(if active) managed by the scubed3 deamon managing the current device.

Level 3: extremely paranoid

while active, the daemon writes blocks to random locations at regular intervals
to hide any real activity, this severely hurts performance. Considerations
of level 2 apply. It will wear out your flash very efficiently.


How to start
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to provide a set of macroblocks to scubed3, to which it has read/write
access. Normally this is either a file or a block device, but it may be
anything. (you would, however, need to write a custom blockio_init_* function
and provide read, write and close methods to it)
